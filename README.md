# Gear Headz
Gear Headz is a website where outdoor enthusiasts can go to recieve quality feedback on various types of outdoor gear. Any user can use the website to simply read, or submit reviews on items that they see listed. If a user doesn't see the item they'd like to review already listed, they can navigate over to the submissions page to submit a new item

## Why Gear Headz?
It can be tough to find true and quality reviews on items throughout the web. Gear Headz is built for true outdoors men & women who don't want to read posts from just anyone - they want to hear a review from a true Gear Head!

## How Gear Headz is Written
Gear heads was written using a JavaScript front end and a Ruby + ActiveRecord back end.

## Future Additions
Future updates will include more security around who can and can not edit or remove posts and items. Right now, Gear Headz runs on the honor system - anyone can add or remove an item without any passwords, however we ask you to please not do so maliciously.
